The Odin Project Foundations course 'The Landing Page' Project. 

This project is for me to build a modern landing page based on this example: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png

CSS style guide: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png

This will test my command line, GIT, HTML & CSS skills.
